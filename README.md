make it easy to run the software for developer.

## notice
- You need to install docker first. In Ubuntu, docker can be installed via `sudo apt install docker`.
- Most of the project uses the latest version, if you want to choose a specific version, you need to update the startup.sh script.  
  For example, in the last line, change mysql --to--> mysql:8.0
